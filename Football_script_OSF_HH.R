##GENERAL INFORMATION:
#This script was made by me, Henrik Herrebrøden (henrikh@henrikh.no). 
#It was made when R was very new to me, so this script may be dramatically improved upon (for example by adding looping).  
#We used this to filter data from Transfermarkt (TM; www.transfermarkt.com) and football federation web sites
#The script demands that data are set up in a certain way in CSV files
#For more information about how to set up and handle data, see the "Data & Instructions" folder on the following web page: https://osf.io/xd3rf/


##INFO ABOUT SCRIPT VERSIONS:
#We used one script version per nation in our original study, since we were interested in national team statistics for the following nations: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Sweden.
#Below is a script example for Belgian players
#If national team statistics is not of interest, the below version will work for players of all nationalities.
#For how to adapt the script to include national team statistics for other nations, see the bottom of this document

##SCRIPT FOR BELGIAN PLAYERS:

#First, set your working directory and install/load packages
setwd("C:/Users/henrher/OneDrive - Universitetet i Oslo/Football project/") # Change this to your local working directory

# List the files that are currently in path.data and choose one to process
football.list <-  data.frame(list.files(path = path.data)) # Create a list of files in path.data
colnames(football.list) <- "files" # Label the column of filenames as "files"
